  Sam - This is a NEW function. It was written by Lee Hayden, a
friend of mine. I gave him credit in the DOCINST member.

You do a 3.4 on any high level qualifier. Then "SRCH" line
command. Then enter whatever variable or arg you want to search
(up to 3 max) . It comes back with 0 to N lines, one line per hit
in each member.

You can then either browse or edit any member by simply placing
an 'S' or 'B' to browse, or an 'E' to edit.

Good luck !
