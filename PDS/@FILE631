//***FILE 631 is from Lee Hayden and Bob Glover, and contains a     *   FILE 631
//*           package to do string searches from an ISPF 3.4 list   *   FILE 631
//*           of datasets.  The package consists of one REXX and    *   FILE 631
//*           two panels.                                           *   FILE 631
//*                                                                 *   FILE 631

//*     You do a 3.4 on any high level qualifier.  Then "SRCH"      *   FILE 631
//*     line command.  Then enter whatever variable or arg you      *   FILE 631
//*     want to search (up to 3 max).  It comes back with 0 to      *   FILE 631
//*     N lines, one line per hit in each member.                   *   FILE 631

//*     You can then either browse or edit any member by simply     *   FILE 631
//*     placing an 'S' or 'B' to browse, or an 'E' to edit.         *   FILE 631
